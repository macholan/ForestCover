# 1. Introduction

Having a complete and accurate record of natural resources helps local and national resource management organizations make informed decisions about how to best preserve or utilize specific types of land. In this study, we examine whether predictive models that employ digital spacial data from geographic information system (GIS) can substitute manual field surveys in order to correctly categorize land forest cover type. 

According to Blackard and Dean's original paper on this subject, "generally, forest cover type data is either directly recorded by field personnel or estimated from remotely sensed data"[include citation and reference], which can be time-consuming and expensive work. Our goal is to assess whether this time and cost could be reduced by relying on data available through digital collection, instead.

*[Placeholder for literature review section about types of models used in our project.]*

# 2. The Modeling Problem

Our aim is to build a multiclass calssification model that can predict the forest cover type for a 30 x 30 meter parcel of land. To do so, we will use data obtained from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) which contains measured attributes for over half a million parcels of land. These attributes include wilderness area type, soil type, the parcel's orientation to water, roadways, and wildfire-prone areas, and other cartographic features.

# 3. The Data

The data used for our study comes from a 1998 study by Blackard and Dean in which US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data and US Geological Survey (USGS) were compiled for 581,012 parcels of land. Each parcel corresponds with a 30 x 30 meter area in one of the following four regions of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado: Rawah, Neota, Comanche Peak, Cache la Poudre. These regions are mapped out in Figure 1.

![Map of wilderness areas included in study from Blackard and Dean's original paper](Fig-1-Study-area-location-map.png)

For each parcel of land, the 13 variables listed in Table 1 were provided for each 30 x 30 meter land parcel (equivalent to one observation in the dataset). For prediction purposes, Forest Cover Type will be used as the dependent variable, and combinations of some or all of the remaining variables as the predictor variables.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Traditional EDA

``` {r forestcoverbarplot, include=FALSE, results=TRUE}
# frequency of forest cover types
barchart(covtype$Cover_Type[order(covtype$Cover_Type)], data = covtype, 
         col = "grey", xlab = "Frequency")
```



### Figure 3: Correlation plot of numeric variables

```{r correlations, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.8, fig.align = "center"}
# correlation plot for numeric variables
corrplot(cor(covtype.training[,1:10]), 
         method = "color", tl.col = "black", tl.cex = 0.5, cl.cex = 0.5)
```


## Model-Based EDA

Model-based exploratory data analysis allows us to glean additional information about the relationships between our predictors and the response variable from naive models applied to the training dataset. In particular, tree-based classification can reveal any possible interaction effects that are not initially apparent from univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis.

### Tree-based Classification Model


```{r rpartmodel, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
treefit <- rpart(Cover_Type ~ ., method = "class", data = covtype.training)
```

```{r rpartsummary, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
printcp(treefit) # display the results 
plotcp(treefit) # visualize cross-validation results 
summary(treefit) # detailed summary of splits
predictions <- round(predict(treefit),0)
predictions.vector <- ifelse(predictions[,1] == 1, "Spruce/Fir", 
                             ifelse(predictions[,2] == 1, "Lodgepole Pine", 
                                    ifelse(predictions[,3] == 1, "Ponderosa Pine",
                                           ifelse(predictions[,4] == 1, "Cottonwood/Willow",
                                                  ifelse(predictions[,5] == 1, "Aspen",
                                                         ifelse(predictions[,6] == 1, "Douglas-fir",
                                                                ifelse(predictions[,7] == 1, "Krummholz", NA)))))))
treefitCM <- confusionMatrix(data = predictions.vector, reference = covtype.training$Cover_Type)
treefitCM$overall["Accuracy"]
```

```{r rpartplotvarimpt, echo = FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, fig.cap = 'Classification Tree Variable Importance Plot', fig.align="center"}
barplot(treefit$variable.importance[order(treefit$variable.importance)], 
        cex.names = 0.5, horiz = TRUE, cex.axis = 0.5, las=1)
```

#### Figure 6: Classification tree 

```{r rpartplot, echo = FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.height = 4.3, fig.aligh = "center"}
rpart.plot(treefit, uniform=TRUE, extra=104, main="", cex = 0.7)
```
  

## K-means Clustering Placeholder

```{r kmeans, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
#comp <- data.frame(pcafit$x[,1:6])
#kmeansfit1 <- kmeans(wine.norm[,2:14], 3)
#kmeansfit2 <- kmeans(comp[,1:6], 3)

# Next Steps for our Paper

* Reach final agreement on sampling approach (i.e. sample randomly across the full dataset vs. sample randomly within each forest cover type category)
* Begin building models using Neural Networks and SVMs
* Figure out how to properly do citations in R Markdown
* Continue refining introduction to align with results from the modeling process
* Begin writing for additional sections of the paper
