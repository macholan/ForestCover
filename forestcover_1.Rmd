# 1. Introduction

Having a complete and accurate record of natural resources helps local and national resource management organizations make informed decisions about how to best preserve or utilize specific types of land. In this study, we examine whether predictive models that employ digital spatial data from geographic information system (GIS) can substitute manual field surveys in order to correctly categorize land forest cover type. 

According to Blackard and Dean's original paper on this subject, "generally, forest cover type data is either directly recorded by field personnel or estimated from remotely sensed data"[include citation and reference], which can be time-consuming and expensive work. Our goal is to assess whether this time and cost could be reduced by relying on data available through digital collection, instead.

*[Placeholder for literature review section about types of models used in our project.]*

# 2. The Modeling Problem

Our aim is to build a multi-class classification model that can predict the forest cover type for a 30 x 30 meter parcel of land. To do so, we will use data obtained from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) which contains measured attributes for over half a million parcels of land. These attributes include wilderness area type, soil type, the parcel's orientation to water, roadways, and wildfire-prone areas, and other cartographic features.

# 3. The Data

The data used for our study comes from a 1998 study by Blackard and Dean in which US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data and US Geological Survey (USGS) were compiled for 581,012 parcels of land. Each parcel corresponds with a 30 x 30 meter area in one of the following four regions of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado: Rawah, Neota, Comanche Peak, Cache la Poudre. These regions are mapped out in Figure 1. 

![Map of wilderness areas included in study from Blackard and Dean's original paper](Fig-1-Study-area-location-map.png)

The 13 variables listed in Table 1 were provided for each 30 x 30 meter land parcel (equivalent to one observation in the dataset). For prediction purposes, Forest Cover Type will be used as the dependent variable, and combinations of some or all of the remaining variables as the predictor variables.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Traditional EDA

An initial examination of the forest cover types in the provided data set shows that the most common types of cover are, by far, Lodgepole Pine (49% of records) and Spruce/Fir (36% of records). Other tree cover types are much rarer for the areas surveyed (<10% of records each) and therefore need to be oversampled in the training data set for building models using Artificial Neural Networks. Figure 2 shows a breakdown of the frequency of each cover type from the full data set.

``` {r forestcoverbarplot, echo = FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap="Forest Cover Type Frequency", fig.height = 2.5, fig.align = "center"}
# frequency of forest cover types
barchart(covtype$Cover_Type,  col = "grey", xlab = "")
#prop.table(table(covtype$Cover_Type))
```

To check the data quality, we first reviewed summary statistical measurements for each variable. None of the variables have missing values, and the range of values for each metric seems reasonable (no unexpected negative or zero-value measurements). 

### Numeric variables
To check for possible outliers and data distribution, we created density plots and boxplots broken out by forest cover class for each numeric variable, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Elevation has a relatively normal distribution across all tree types, whereas other variables do not. The right-skewed variables (Horizontal Distance to Hydrology, Vertical Distance to Hydrology, and Horizontal Distance to Firepoints) and the left-skewed variables (Hillshade at 9am and Hillshade at Noon) may need to undergo transformations for any modeling procedures that assume normality for the predictor variables. Aspect is a unique variable in that it shows a bimodal distribution.

Elevation appears to be the most differentiating numeric variable across forest cover types, which makes it an especially good candidate for inclusion in our models.

``` {r densityplots, echo=FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap = "Density plots of numeric variables", fig.height = 4, fig.aligh = "center"}
# create density plot
p=list()
for(i in 1:10){
    p[[i]] <- ggplot(covtype, aes_string(x=colnames(covtype)[i])) + 
      geom_density() + 
      #theme_adMobile() + 
      theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(),
              axis.title.x=element_text(size=6),
              axis.text=element_text(size=6))
}
do.call(grid.arrange,c(p,ncol=4))
```

```{r boxplots, echo=FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap = "Boxplots of numeric variables by Forest Cover Type", fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 9, fig.aligh = "center"}
layout(matrix(1:10,5,2,byrow = TRUE), widths = c(rep(.5,10)), heights = c(rep(1.5,10)))
par(oma = c(0,0,0,0), mar = c(2.5,8,2.5,2.5))
for (i in c(1:10)) {
    boxplot(covtype[,i] ~ Cover_Type, data = covtype, axes = FALSE, 
            border = TRUE, horizontal = TRUE)
    par(cex.main = 0.9, cex.axis = 0.8)
    title(colnames(covtype)[i], line = 0.8)
    axis(2, las=1, at = 1:7, labels = levels(covtype$Cover_Type))
}
```

To understand the relationships between the numeric predictor variables, we can examine the correlation plot in Figure 5.

There are six pairwise correlations that have a value higher than absolute 0.5
  
*   Hillshade at 9am, Hillshade at 3pm (-0.78)
*   Aspect, Hillshade at 3pm (0.65)
*   Horizontal Distance to Hydrology, Vertical Distance to Hydrology (0.61)
*   Slope, Hillshade at Noon (-0.61)
*   Hillshade at Noon, Hillshade at 3pm (0.59)
*   Aspect, Hillshade at 9am (-0.58)

```{r correlations, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "Correlations for Numeric Variables", fig.align = "center"}
# correlation plot for nummeric variables
corrplot(cor(covtype[,c(1:10)]),  method = "color", tl.col = "black", 
         tl.cex = 0.5, cl.cex = 0.5)
```

The scatterplots in Figure 6 help us examine these highly correlated variables more closely. From the plots, we observe the following: 
*   The hillshade at noon and 3pm creates an ellipsoid pattern. 
*   As the horizontal distance to a hydrology increases, the variance in vertical distance to hydrology increases. 
*   As slope increases hillshade at noon decreases, with wider variance at steeper slopes. 
*   Hillshade at 3pm has a sigmoidal relationship with Aspect. 
*   Aspect and Hillshade at 9am have a more defined sigmoidal relationship. 

``` {r scatterplots, echo=FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap = "Scatterplots of Highly Correlated Numeric Variables", fig.align = "center"}
corrFeature1<-c("Hillshade_Noon","Hillshade_9am","Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology","Slope","Aspect","Aspect","Elevation")
corrFeature2<-c("Hillshade_3pm","Hillshade_3pm","Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology","Hillshade_Noon","Hillshade_9am","Hillshade_3pm","Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways")

# sample since there are too many points to plot all
scatterTemp <- sample_n(covtype,5000)

p=list()
for(i in 1:length(corrFeature1)){
    p[[i]] <- ggplot(scatterTemp, aes_string(x=corrFeature1[i],y=corrFeature2[i])) +
        geom_point(alpha=1/10) +
        theme(axis.title.y=element_text(size=6),
              axis.title.x=element_text(size=6),
              axis.text=element_text(size=6))
}
do.call(grid.arrange,c(p,ncol=3))
```

### Categorical variables

```{r soiltype, echo = FALSE, display = FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data=covtype) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Cover_Type,fill=Cover_Type),color="black") + 
  facet_wrap(~Soil_Type,scale="free") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Count") + 
  ylab("Tree Cover Type") + 
  #ggtitle("Coverage Type vs Region")+
  theme(axis.text=element_blank()) + 
  theme(legend.position= "bottom")
```

A dot plot of forest cover type by wilderness area in Figure 7 shows the following trends:  

*   Wilderness Area 1 has a higher proportion of Lodgepole Pines than any of the other areas.
*   Wilderness Area 2 has a higher proportion of Spruce/Fir and Krumholz trees than any of the other areas.
*   Wilderness Area 3 has a higher proportion of Aspens than any of the other areas.
*   Wilderness Area 4 has a higher proportion of Ponderosa Pines, Douglas Firs, and Cottonwood/Willow trees than any of the other areas.

```{r wildernessdotplot, echo=FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap="Proportion of Cover Type within each Wilderness Area", fig.align="center"}
wilderness.table <- table(covtype$Cover_Type, covtype$Wilderness_Area)
wilderness.table.freq <- prop.table(wilderness.table, 2)
dotplot(wilderness.table.freq, groups = FALSE, layout = c(4,1), 
        aspect = 1, origin = 0, type = c("p", "h"), cex = 0.4,
        xlab = "Proportion", par.settings=mytheme)
```

A dot plot of forest cover type by soil type in Figure 8 also shows variability in the proportion of tree types from soil to soil. For example, some soil types show a very high proportion of Lodgepole Pines (e.g. Soil Type 7) whereas others show a very low proportion of Lodgepole Pines (e.g. Soil Type 37). The distinctive make-up of trees by soil type suggests that this may be a good predictive factor for our models.  

```{r soildotplot, echo=FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap="Proportion of Forest Cover by Soil Type", fig.align="center"}
soil.table <- table(covtype$Cover_Type, covtype$Soil_Type)
soil.table.freq <- prop.table(soil.table, 2)
dotplot(soil.table.freq, groups = FALSE, layout = c(8, 5), 
        aspect = 1, origin = 0, type = c("p", "h"), cex = 0.4,
        xlab = "Proportion", par.settings=mytheme)
```

## Model-Based EDA

# create training, test, and validation sets of data
# set sample size for training, test, and validation
fractionTraining   <- 0.25
fractionValidation <- 0.25

# compute sample sizes

# set the indeces for the training, validation, and sample sets
indicesTraining    <- sort(sample(seq_len(nrow(covtype)), size=sampleSizeTraining))
indicesNotTraining <- setdiff(seq_len(nrow(covtype)), indicesTraining)

# create the three dataframes for training, validation, and test
covtype.training   <- covtype[indicesTraining, ]

covtype.test       <- covtype[indicesTest, ]

Model-based exploratory data analysis allows us to glean additional information about the relationships between our predictors and the response variable from naive models applied to the training dataset. In particular, tree-based classification can reveal which features are most important for prediction and any possible interaction effects that are not initially apparent from univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis.

### Simple Tree-based Classification Model

By creating a simple tree-based classification model, we confirm that Elevation is the most important predictor of forest cover type. 

Other variables that could be important to defining models are shown in the variable importance plot in Figure 9.

```{r rpartmodel, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
treefit <- rpart(Cover_Type ~ ., method = "class", data = covtype.training[c(1:55)])
treefit <- treefit
```

```{r rpartsummary, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
printcp(treefit) # display the results 
plotcp(treefit) # visualize cross-validation results 
summary(treefit) # detailed summary of splits
predictions <- round(predict(treefit),0)
predictions.vector <- ifelse(predictions[,1] == 1, "Spruce/Fir", 
                      ifelse(predictions[,2] == 1, "Lodgepole Pine", 
                      ifelse(predictions[,3] == 1, "Ponderosa Pine",
                      ifelse(predictions[,4] == 1, "Cottonwood/Willow",
                      ifelse(predictions[,5] == 1, "Aspen",
                      ifelse(predictions[,6] == 1, "Douglas-fir",
                      ifelse(predictions[,7] == 1, "Krummholz", NA)))))))
treefitCM <- confusionMatrix(data = predictions.vector, reference = covtype.training$Cover_Type)
treefitCM$overall["Accuracy"]
```

```{r rpartplotvarimpt, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = 'Naive Classification Tree Variable Importance Plot', fig.align="center"}
barplot(treefit$variable.importance[order(treefit$variable.importance)], 
        cex.names = 0.4, horiz = TRUE, cex.axis = 0.5, las=1)
```

A plot of the decision tree in Figure 10 shows that this model has significant limitations and ignores the rarer tree types in partitioning the data. With an accuracy of only 7%, we learn that a much more sophisticated model will be required to predict cover type.

```{r rpartplot, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.height = 4.3, fig.cap= "Naive Classification Tree", fig.aligh = "center"}
rpart.plot(treefit, uniform=TRUE, extra=104, main="", cex = 0.7)
```

### Random Forest Model

According to the importance plot for a random forest model, the elevation variable has the higest importance, followed by soil type, the horizontal distance to roadways, and the horizontal distance to wildfire points. Figure 11 shows the ranking and relative importance of the variables selected.

``` {r randomforest, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, display = FALSE}
# use a sample of the data for the rf calculation as it takes long time
sampleIndex <- createDataPartition(covtype$Cover_Type, p = .1, list = FALSE, times = 1)
rf <- randomForest(Cover_Type~. ,covtype[sampleIndex,c(1:10,55:57)], importance.type = 1)
#importance(rf)

```

``` {r randomforestimpt, echo = FALSE, display = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Random Forest Variable Importance Plot', fig.height = 4, fig.align="center"}
varImpPlot(rf,type=2, main = "")
```

### Boruta Model

According to the boruta algorithm for feature selection, elevation, again, has the highest importance. *[Add comments on variable importance here after running algorithm -- couldn't get results on Christina's machine.]*

``` {r boruta, echo = FALSE, display = FALSE}
# Boruta Model - comment out for knit
# bor.results <- Boruta(covtype.training, covtype.training$Cover_Type, maxRuns=200)
```

``` {r borutaplot, echo = FALSE, display = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Boruta Model
plot(bor.results)
names(bor.results)
bor.results$finalDecision
CONFIRMED_VAR <- getSelectedAttributes(bor.results)
Boruta_output <- attStats(bor.results)
```

# Next Steps for our Paper

* Reach final agreement on sampling approach (i.e. sample randomly across the full dataset vs. sample randomly within each forest cover type category).  
* Begin building models four to five possible models using Artificial Neural Networks, SVMs, Lasso, and Ridge Regression.  
* Figure out how to properly do citations in R Markdown.  
* Continue refining introduction to align with results from the modeling process.  
* Begin writing for additional sections of the paper.  
* Continue to revise EDA -- include only what's most important once modeling is complete.
